# Coref Model Analyzer Debug Tool - Temporary Working Version

## Description
The [original github project](https://github.com/MangoLion/coref-debug-tool) has been rendered completely unsusable due to the corrupted package.json file making it impossible to setup the project at all. [Issue link](https://github.com/preschool-lab/coref-debug-tool/issues/1)

To debug my model results from using the preco dataset, I have attempted to manually install the missing packages, setup react app and other needed frameworks.

Since it is impossible to build with react, a "snapshot" build from src and public folder was moved to a new react app. The app should function with some errors.

## Installation

``npm install``

## Running

``npm start``
